ENTS Pop-Pi Documentation
==========

This folder contains various points of information for the mechanical and electronic
components of the project. Files in here are kept to a minimum as they are mostly for
quick code reference or contain some information essential to the project. Larger
files are to be stored elsewhere (or to abuse GitHub's LFS soon?).

Note: I have zero graphical ability, so some things may not be aligned, look bad, or
may just be bad.
